// Homework 1

// 1. **Using string concatenation add two different strings together and print this off.**
console.log('hello' + ' ' + 'world');

// 2. **Using variables create a variable for a number, a string. Then print each of these variables.**
let firstWorld = 'hello';
let secondWord = 2;
console.log(firstWorld);
console.log(secondWord);

// 3. **Using string concatenation in javascript combine 3 different variables and prints it off. I.e variable for name age and date of birth will result in “my name is abdulkadir I am 24 years old and I was born in 1998”. (you cannot use name age and dob as your variables).**
let myName = 'abdulkadir';
let myAge = 24;
let myDOB = 99;

console.log(
  'my name is ' + myName + ', I am ' + myAge + ' and I was born in ' + myDOB
);

// 4. **Create a variables that hold both numbers and strings and print this off**
console.log(firstWorld, secondWord);
